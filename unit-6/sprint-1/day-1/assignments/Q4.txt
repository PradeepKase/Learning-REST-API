    Ans =>There are 3 types of maven repository:
            (i) Local Repository
            (ii) Central Repository
            (iii) Remote Repository
            
            Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:
            Local repository then Central repository then Remote repository.
            If dependency is not found in these repositories, maven stops processing and throws an error.
            
            1)     Maven Local Repository :- Maven local repository is located in your local system. It is created by the maven when you run any maven command.
            2) Maven Central Repository :- Maven central repository is located on the web. It has been created by the apache maven community itself.
            3) Maven Remote Repository :- Maven remote repository is located on the web. Most of libraries can be missing from the central repositorysuch as JBoss library etc, so we need to define remote repository in pom.xml file
